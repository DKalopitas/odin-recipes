    <h2>Best Easy Philly Cheesesteak</h2>


    <p>Turns out that combining seared beef, caramelized onions, bell peppers, and melty cheese is delicious! Just take a look at this Philly Cheesesteak recipe. Then there are saucy and meaty sloppy joes. One day I was inspired to mash the two together to create these cheesesteak sloppy joes—magic stuffed between toasted buns. It's delicious and I hope you try it!
    </p>


    <p>Brown lean ground beef, chopped onions, and bell peppers and create a quick sauce with ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and a little beef stock. Fold in pieces of provolone into the warm sauce creating a gooey, cheesy, meaty concoction loved by all. Add a slice of provolone to toasted brioche buns, top with the Philly cheesesteak sloppy joe mixture, and you’ve got a quick tasty dinner on your hands.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>


    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 small white onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound lean beef, 90/10 blend</li>
        <li>1/2 cup beef stock</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>12 slices provolone cheese, divided</li>
        <li>6 brioche buns, store-bought or homemade</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>


    <ol>

        <li>Cook the vegetables</li>
        <p>In a large skillet set over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onions and bell peppers. Cook until soften, 6 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently. The vegetables shouldn’t brown at this point, just soften.
        </p>


        <li>Cook the beef</li>
        <p>Add the ground beef and use a wooden spoon to break it up into small pieces as it cooks. Cook until the meat is browned, 5 to 6 minutes.
        </p>


        <li>Make it saucy</li>
        <p>Stir in the stock, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Turn the heat down to low and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes until the mixture thickens.

            Stack 6 slices provolone cheese on a cutting board and use a chef’s knife to cut them into 1/2-inch pieces. Right before serving, stir in the cut cheese.
        </p>


        <li>Assemble the sloppy joes</li>
        <p>Toast the brioche buns in a toaster oven or toaster. Lay the remaining 6 slices provolone cheese on each brioche bun half. Top the cheese with heaping spoonfuls of the sloppy joe mixture and the top bun. Serve warm.

            If you have leftover sloppy joe mixture, good news! It keeps beautifully in the fridge for 4 to 5 days and reheats well in the microwave or in a skillet with a splash of water or stock. 
            
            You can freeze the mixture in freezer-safe container for 3 months. Thaw it before reheating. If you need to thaw it quickly, you can do so in the microwave.
